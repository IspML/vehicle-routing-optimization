# Capacitated VRP - CVRP

## Problem Statement

Write an algorithm to solve the vehicle routing problem. The problem is mathematically formulated in the following way: We are given a list of locations N = 0 . . . n − 1. By convention, location 0 is the warehouse location, where all of the vehicles start and end their routes. The remaining locations are customers. Each location is characterized by three values ⟨di, xi, yi⟩ i ∈ N a demand di and a point xi,yi. The fleet of vehicles V = 0...v − 1 is fixed and each vehicle has a limited capacity c. All of the demands assigned to a vehicle cannot exceed its capacity c. For each vehicle i ∈ V , let Ti be the sequence of customer deliveries made by that vehicle and let dist(c1, c2) be the
Euclidean distance between two customers. Then the vehicle routing problem is formalized as the following optimization problem.

* *__n__* Locations, *__v__* Vehicles
* For each location
  * demand *__di__* and location *__xi,yi__*
* The capacity of the vehicles *__c__*
